# BugLord 2.0 Roadmap

> **Status:** In active redevelopment
> **Target platforms:** Android + iOS
> **Goal:** Transform the original BugLord FYP prototype into a polished, testable, commercially viable application ready to progress toward public release.

---

## 1. Vision

BugLord is a gamified insect-collecting application that combines real-world insect discovery with collection, progression, exploration, and turn-based gameplay.

BugLord 2.0 will move the project beyond its Final Year Project prototype by rebuilding areas that were limited by academic scope, licensing restrictions, infrastructure costs, and time constraints.

The primary goals of BugLord 2.0 are to:

* Own and control the machine-learning classification pipeline.
* Improve scanning accuracy and reliability.
* Stabilise the existing core application.
* Expand BugLord's gameplay loop.
* Introduce a cohesive game-focused visual identity.
* Support Android and iOS.
* Build infrastructure suitable for eventual commercial deployment.
* Introduce sustainable, non-predatory monetisation.
* Establish automated testing and development workflows.
* Produce a polished build suitable for extensive user testing and progression toward release.

BugLord 2.0 is **not simply a UI overhaul**. Core architecture and functionality should be stabilised before significant visual redesign work begins.

---

# 2. Development Principles

Development of BugLord 2.0 should follow several principles.

### Stability before expansion

Existing systems should work reliably before large new systems are added.

### Functionality before visual redesign

Core APIs, data structures, ML integration, and gameplay flows should be stabilised before redesigning their UI.

### Commercial ownership

New dependencies, datasets, models, APIs, assets, and services should be checked for licensing restrictions before becoming core parts of the commercial application.

### Cross-platform development

Unless a platform limitation makes this impossible, features should be designed for both Android and iOS rather than treating one platform as an afterthought.

### Testable development

Major systems should include automated tests and clear acceptance criteria.

### Incremental delivery

Large features should be split into independently testable milestones rather than implemented as one large change.

# 4. Post-BugLord 2.0

The following features are deliberately excluded from the initial BugLord 2.0 scope unless development priorities change.

## Multiplayer Battles

Real-time or asynchronous player-vs-player battles are planned for a later milestone.

Potential future work:

* Matchmaking.
* Friends battles.
* Ranked battles.
* Casual battles.
* Competitive seasons.
* Leaderboards.
* Server-authoritative combat.
* Anti-cheat systems.
* PvP balancing.

Multiplayer should only be introduced after the core combat system has proven enjoyable and stable in Hive Mode.

---

## Other Future Possibilities

Potential future expansions include:

* Seasonal insects.
* Seasonal Hive Mode content.
* Limited events.
* Community challenges.
* Collector achievements.
* Regional collections.
* Advanced social profiles.
* Clubs/guilds.
* Friend activity feeds.
* Cooperative challenges.
* Rare encounter events.
* Trading marketplace improvements.
* Expanded cosmetics.
* New equipment sets.
* New Hive biomes.
* Boss insects.
* Field research challenges.

These ideas should not delay BugLord 2.0.

---

# 5. Current Development Priority

The current order of work should be:

**1. Repository/Foundation**

↓

**2. Commercial Dataset**

↓

**3. BugLord ML Model**

↓

**4. Inference Backend**

↓

**5. Scanning Integration**

↓

**6. Core Reliability**

↓

**7. Walk Mode**

↓

**8. UI Redesign**

↓

**9. BugDex Expansion**

↓

**10. Hive Mode 2.0**

↓

**11. Economy**

↓

**12. Monetisation**

↓

**13. Testing/UAT**

↓

**14. Security & Production Infrastructure**

↓

**15. Release Candidate**

This ordering is intentional. Visual redesign and major gameplay expansion should not interrupt the work required to replace the ML system and stabilise BugLord's underlying architecture.

---

# 6. Immediate Next Milestone

The immediate focus is the **BugLord commercial classification pipeline**.

### Next tasks

* [x] Restore/create `docs/ml/BUGLORD_ML_V2_SPEC.md`.
* [x] Restore/create `training/schemas/commercial_dataset_manifest.schema.json`.
* [x] Implement dataset manifest validation.
* [x] Add manifest validator tests.
* [x] Identify commercially compatible insect datasets.
* [x] Establish the first dataset version.
* [x] Establish the baseline training experiment.
* [x] [REVIEW] Finalise BugDex taxonomy v0.1.
* [x] [REVIEW] Complete BIOSCAN-5M commercial rights review.

* [ ] [REVIEW] Complete the approved BIOSCAN v0.1 archive download.
* [ ] [AUTO] Prepare and validate the downloaded BIOSCAN v0.1 dataset.
* [ ] [REVIEW]Train and evaluate the first BugLord-owned classifier.

Development should remain focused on this milestone before beginning unrelated BugLord 2.0 feature work.

---

# 7. Roadmap Maintenance

This roadmap is a living document.

When work is completed:

* Mark the corresponding task as complete.
* Add newly discovered required work to the appropriate phase.
* Avoid adding speculative features to the active development path.
* Move non-essential ideas into the post-2.0 section.
* Update completion criteria when architecture decisions materially change.
* Prefer GitHub issues for detailed implementation discussions.
* Keep this roadmap focused on project-level progress and dependencies.

The roadmap should answer one question at any point during development:

> **What is the most important thing BugLord needs next to move closer to release?**
